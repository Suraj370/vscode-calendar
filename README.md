# VSCode Calendar

Simple calendar extension for Visual Studio Code — add, edit, delete, and schedule reminders for dated tasks directly inside VS Code. Features include month view with white tiles, drag-and-drop to move tasks between days, right-click task inspector, time selection, and in-editor reminders.

## Features

* Month calendar UI inside a Webview

* Create / edit / delete tasks (title, date, time, notes)

* Task priority (high / medium / low) and custom color

* vDrag & drop task chips between days to move them

* Right-click Task Inspector: Edit | Copy details | Delete

* Reminder support — schedule reminders (minutes before a task time); fires as a VS Code notification while VS Code is running

* Tasks persisted with globalState (survive VS Code restarts; reminder timers do not persist across restarts)
